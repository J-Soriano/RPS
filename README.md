## Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
---

Simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors game from The Odin Project curriculum. [Live Demo](https://j-soriano.github.io/RPS/) :point_left:

### First stage | Game in the browser console
* Learned more about **functions & loops**.
* Made function case-insensitive.


### Second stage | Game with added UI

* Learned basic **manipulations of elements styles** through the DOM via JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).
* Improved my **understanding of JavaScript functions** (organization, workspaces, scopes, calling, invoking, etc).
